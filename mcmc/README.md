Markov Chain Monte Carlo
========================
Methods used for solving stochastic equations, sampling statistical distributions, and calculating integrals. It is based on the use of pseudorandom numbers. The basic technique assumes samples of independent random variables. Other more efficient techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, assume a dependency between the random variables.
