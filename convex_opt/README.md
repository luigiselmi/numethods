Convex Optimization
===================
Optimization problems are common in many quantitative fields, from Physics to Finance. The goal is to find a maximum, or minimum, of a function under some constraints given as equations or inequalities. For example in Finance a typical problem is to find a portfolio of securities with the highest return under a specific risk. Depending on the type of function these problems can be classified as linear optimization or convex optimization. These problems are difficult to solve in closed form and are usually solved using numerical solvers.
